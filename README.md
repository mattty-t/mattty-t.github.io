**Purpose**

The purpose of this website is to showcase the skills that I have learned so far during my time at CoderAcademy. By utilising the knowledge I have learned to design a website using HTML and CSS. This site will also evolve over time as my skills improve. It is to showcase my current and future projects and acts as a online resume for future employers. I have kept this site minimalistic, simple and vibrant. It shows the design and style I would like to pursue.
