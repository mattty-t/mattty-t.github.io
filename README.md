**Target audience**

The target audience for my website is for potential employers who are looking for front-end/full stack-developers.

**Tech stack (e.g. html, css, deployment platform, etc)**

I used Visual Studio Code to code my website. I mainly used Front-end tech stack of:  
<uL>
<li> <b>HTML</b> - used to to design my website and pages (home, about, skills, blog and contact). Using semantic tags such as header, section, main, footer for most of my pages. I used article for my blog page. I used these semantics to define different types of the page and makes it easier for the browser and other people looking at my code to better understand the layout of my page. </li>
<li> <b>CSS</b> - used to format and style the layout of my website and also adjust the font size and style, color, of my webpages. </li> 
<br>

I used other tech stack listed below to help assist with my website:
<li> <b>JavaScript</b> - Used to code a toggle button feature for my hamburger navigation bar when the screen goes below 400px for mobile.
</li>
<li> <b>GitHub</b> - Used to create a GitHub repository on my GitHub account which will allow me to edit and push my changes to it. It also allowed me to deploy my site from a static website to a dynamic website.
</li>
<li> <b>Trello</b> - Used to help me keep me accountable for </li>
<li> <b>Font-Awesome</b> - I used their icons on the website to make my website more visually appealing for my social-icons and also for my skills page</li>
